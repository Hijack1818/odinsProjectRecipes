		American goulash was one of my all-time favorite comfort food meals when I was growing up. They served it in my
		school cafeteria alongside a slice of buttered white bread and a carton of milk. This Americanized version of
		goulash was invented to stretch a small amount of beef into enough food for a not-so-small family. It's a simple
		dish that doesn't taste simple, so it's perfect for your weeknight dinner rotation.

	<h3>
		Directions
	</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Step1</li>
		<p>Gather all ingredients.</p>
		<li>Step2</li>
		<p>Heat oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Add ground beef and onion; cook and stir until beef is browned and
			crumbly and onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Continue to cook and stir until liquid is evaporated, 3
			to 5 minutes. Add garlic, bay leaves, paprika, Italian seasoning, salt, black pepper, and cayenne.</p>
		<li>Step3</li>
		<p>Cook, stirring occasionally, until flavors come together, about 3 minutes. Pour in broth, marinara sauce, and
			diced tomatoes. Pour water into the sauce jar, swirl, and pour into the pot. Stir in soy sauce; bring to a
			simmer. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until flavors intensify, about 30 minutes.</p>
		<li>Step4</li>
		<p>Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a rapid simmer. Stir in macaroni; cook, stirring occasionally,
			until just barely tender, about 12 minutes. Check for doneness after 10 minutes.</p>
		<li>Step5</li>
		<p>Remove from the heat and discard bay leaves. Stir in Cheddar and parsley. Cover and let rest for 5 minutes.
			Taste and season as desired.</p>
